It appears doesn't really exists like I would. Thus was born this project.\r\nI share it as a version 1.0. Feel free to improve with PR.\r\n\r\n**JS in ECMA6**  \r\nSee class \r\n```\r\nTimeline(defaultPixelByYear = 365, shouldDisplayDate = true, shouldDisplayDescription = true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What it does**\r\n\r\nVertical timeline with a mainline containing years. On each side of it, you place your data.\r\nThe top of mainline is TODAY. The bottom is the oldest date you created in your activities.\r\nYou can create your own categories, choose their associate colour and the order you want to display its in the legend.\r\n\r\n**Concrete use**\r\n```\r\nlet tl = new Timeline(365, true, true);\r\ntl.addActivities([\r\n         ['left',   'work',      {start:new Date(2016,0,2), end:new Date(2016,5,2)},  {title:'Something', description:'Somewhere, somehow'}],\r\n         ['right',  'studies',   {start:new Date(2016,5,1), end:new Date()},          {title:'Bachelor Informatic', description:'Somewhere in Peru'}],\r\n         ['right',  'other',     {start:new Date(2015,1,1), end:new Date(2015,4,1)},  {title:'Python Dev', description:'Somewhere in Switzerland'}]\r\n     ]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's the minimum.\r\nIn addition, you can set your own categories before adding activities with :\r\n```\r\ntl.setCategories([\r\n        {name:'work',color:'yellowgreen', displayOrderInLegend: 1},\r\n        {name:'studies',color:'dodgerblue', displayOrderInLegend: 2},\r\n        {name:'other',color:'orchid', displayOrderInLegend: 3}\r\n    ]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, 3 categories are created : *work*, *studies* and *other*.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n- Dynamic date locale (parameter of `date.toLocaleString` is currently harcoded 'en-EN')\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n### Who manage this project ? ###\r\n* Keiro(@Keirodev)",
